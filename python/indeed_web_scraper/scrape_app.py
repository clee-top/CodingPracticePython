# This Flask webserver serves one endpoint "/scrapeIndeed". If you post something like the above example it will spool
# up some subprocesses to process the urls and scrape their content. Currently configured at 20 since the requirements
# said they wanted to process up to 100 url's in less then 10 seconds and 20 subprocesses is a fairly sane amount for
# most common machines this server would run on. It also chugs through 100 urls in ~ 3 seconds on my machine with
# these settings.
