Project: Web Scraper

From: Jobr/Monster

Instructions:

Write a web server that scrapes job listings from Indeed and returns the job titles, locations, and company names.
The server should parallelize tasks so that it can handle a large number of URLs (up to 100 URLs) without taking too
long (less than 10s).  Please provide a timer on the server side which outputs the time taken per request.

Keep in mind that this exercise should only take a couple hours, so focus on the happy path.
Don’t spend too much time or code handling rare edge cases.

Request format:

POST /get_jobs HTTP/1.0

Content-Type: application/json

[

“http://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=8cfd54301d909668”,

You can complete the challenge in any language you would like.
Though, please provide us with a guide on how to run the code.
Also, provide a README and a github page so that we can clone your repo and easily run the server program.
