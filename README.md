# Coding Practice
Public repository where I keep all my practice questions, challenges, projects, tech screens and such for any prospective employer to look at. Organized by what lanaguage/frameworks I used. For interviews or other stuff that happened in the moment I mark with "N ->"  as notes after the fact is applicable, for tech screens for example to preserve the text from how it was written during the screen. Sometimes they are timed as well. That'll be in the annotated notes at the top.
