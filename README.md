# Coding Practice. Records of Leetcode, Hackerank, Programming Interviews Exposed, Cracking the Code Interview problems, and technical screens given by companies.
Public repository where I keep all my practice questions, challenges, projects, tech screens and such for any prospective employer to look at. Organized by what lanaguage/frameworks I used. For interviews or other stuff that happened in the moment I mark them at the top of the file with an "N ->" to clarify that they are notes after the fact. For tech screens I attempt to preserve the text from how it was written during the screen. Sometimes there are other facets annotated such as the ones that are timed as well. Any edits I make to tech screens AFTER the tech screen I also mark, but this is rare.
