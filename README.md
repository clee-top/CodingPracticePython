# Coding Practice
Public repository where I keep all my practice questions, challenges, projects, tech screens and such for any prospective employer to look at. Organized by what lanaguage/frameworks I used. For interviews or other stuff that happened in the moment I mark with "N ->"  as notes after the fact is applicable, for tech screens for example.
