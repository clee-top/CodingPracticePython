# CodingPracticePython
Practice in Python. Interview questions are much easier to answer in Python and I've been using it more recently anyway. Organized by type and/or company since they give take-homes and tech screens
and whatnot. Mark stuff with "N ->"  as notes after the fact is applicable (For tech screens for example)
