# Example build commmand:
# docker build -t indeed-scraper:latest .

#Example run command:
#  -d detaches the container and runs in the background which is great since it's a web server and we want it to
#  sit around listening for calls to it passively.
#  -p 5000:5000 links the host port 5000 to docker port 5000 so we can make calls to this thing to our host as if
#  it was running locally.
# "docker run -d -p 5000:5000 indeed-scraper:latest"
